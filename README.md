<h1>Quadratic-functions-for-a-parabola⛏</h1>
<p>Welcome👋, this is a program which I am developing to be able to graph a parabola starting from a quadratic function, this program is a beta version of the final</p>

<h2>PROGRAM OPERATION</h2>

<p>First, it asks us for the data, a b and c of the quadratic function to then perform the corresponding operations</p>

<p>then it returns the parameters of the roots and the intercept in y , at the end it provides us with the vertex</p>
